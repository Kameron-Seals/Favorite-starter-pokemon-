# Favorite-starter-pokemon-
.Favorite starter Pok√©mon (will include website that actually is pushed through using google cloud console)
The data in this will not work on a static repository system like Github Had to push it through goole cloud but wanted the back and front end code to be accessible for myself for reivew in the future


Things I want to add
1.treemap
2.Fix the logic surrounding the results.ejs on the calculating the top 3 favorte and least favorite
3. make a custom domain name which ill have to pay for unfortunatley but will be easier to present as something im hosting myself (since I literaly controle the whole consloe through my google cloud terminal)
4 Make a siter project with all 1000+ pokemon and other ways to interact( maybe a fourm page that limits up to 20 different threads with about 200-300 post limit)
5. If i do go the forum route being able to display top 3 in a more logic oriented way would help tremendously
6. Once i fix the logic surronding the top 3 add it to the same stylesheet format as the form and legend
7. move on, this is a fun project but honestly a better stepping stone to tackle bigger scopes of work.
