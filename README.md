# Favorite Starter Pokémon

Favorite starter Pokémon (website hosted through Google Cloud Console). The data in this project will not work on a static repository system like GitHub; it is pushed through Google Cloud but the backend and frontend code are accessible for future review.

## Project Description

This project includes a web-based survey to gather data on people's favorite starter Pokémon. The website is built with HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, and JavaScript, and hosted on Google Cloud Console.

## Planned Improvements

1. Add a treemap visualization.
2. ~~Fix the logic in `results.ejs` to accurately calculate the top 3 favorite and least favorite Pokémon.~~
3. Obtain a custom domain name to enhance presentation.
4. Create a sister project with all 1000+ Pokémon and interactive features (e.g., a forum page with up to 20 threads and a 200-300 post limit).
5. ~~Improve logic for displaying the top 3 Pokémon in a more organized manner.~~
6. ~~Integrate the top 3 display into the same stylesheet format as the form and legend.~~
7. Continue developing this project as a stepping stone for tackling larger scopes of work.
8. Add sprites next to options on index page 
9. ~~gcloude console on mobile is not letting me push through my reset command look into that.
## Technologies Used~~. [Seems like if I just the console on the website it works fine dunno why the mobile app can never verify the right token]
